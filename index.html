  <p>The Maine Coon, as the name implies, hails from Maine, where the breed was known as a popular mouser, farm cat, and ship's cat, as far back as the early 19th century. They're a natural breed and little is known of their origins. Some say the Vikings brought them to North America, centuries before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Others say that they're the descendants of longhaired cats belonging to Marie Antoinette, sent to America in advance of the doomed queen, who had hoped to escape there. Sea captains may have brought back longhaired cats that then mated with local shorthaired cats. One thing is for sure--the Maine Coon is not the result of a mating between a cat and a raccoon, even if their brown tabby coat and furry ringed tail suggest that biological impossibility. The resemblance is, however, how the cats got the "Coon" part of their name. In fact, Maine Coons who didn't have the brown tabby coat were called Maine Shags.</p>

      <p>The Maine Coon is known for its large size and thick double coat of long hair which is well suited for the harsh winters in Maine, the state from which they originated. Relaxed and laid-back, Maine Coons are not overly dependent, but they are people oriented. They are happy to follow their owners from room to room, coming when called and playing fetch. Some Maine Coons are attracted to water and may even enjoy an occasional swim.</p>
